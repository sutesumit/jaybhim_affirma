I see how generations of caste-patriarchal trauma have numbed us, making vulnerability a distant memory. In his absence, I found father figures in books, movements, and idols, but I wonder—can I unlearn this inherited distance?",

Dr. Ambedkar’s writings became my refuge, an ideal father figure who taught me to question, think, and feel. But can the warmth of an imagined father fill the void of a real one?",

How do I transform what was hollow into something whole? Perhaps by speaking, by feeling, by moving the pieces of my story until they make sense.",
