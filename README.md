## About the Project

[art.sumitsute.com](https://art.sumitsute.com/) is the portfolio website of lens-based visual artist Sumit Sute, showcasing his artistic practice over the past few years. Sute, whose career began in documentary photography for media, governments, and NGOs, and who later served as a photo editor at a leading Indian news organization, has developed a practice deeply informed by photography and the feminist principle that "the personal is political." This website, thoughtfully crafted with web technologies, invites viewers to reflect, engage, and respond.
